# [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)

This repository has some small jupyter notebooks that I do when I have some free time, mostly using python :snake: with numpy and matplotlib.

## Table of contents
- [Newton's theory of gravitation simulation for rocky planets](https://github.com/bleachman2/Small_notebooks/blob/master/gravitation_simulation.ipynb) Scipt that simulates the movement of the Solar System's Rocky Planets around the sun following Newton's gravitation laws, it creates an animation to visualize the simulation [Video example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bleachman2/Small_notebooks/master/video_exapmles/gravitation_video.mp4)
- [Small elastic colision simulation on a plinko like game](https://github.com/bleachman2/Small_notebooks/blob/master/Elastic_colision_plinko.ipynb) Script that simulates the elastic colisions between a falling ball and several rigid balls on fixes points, aquin to the "plinko" game. It creates an animation to visualize the simulation [Video example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bleachman2/Small_notebooks/master/video_exapmles/plinko_video.mp4)
- [QR factorization](https://github.com/bleachman2/Small_notebooks/blob/master/QR.ipynb) decomposes a matrix into a Q and R parts and uses them to find it's eigenvectors and eigenvalues
- [LU decomposition for tridiagonal matrixes](https://github.com/bleachman2/Small_notebooks/blob/master/LU_tridiagonal.ipynb) script for decomposing a Matrix in an U-upper and a L-lower matrix, it also resolves the subsequent Mx=b system
- [Gauss-Seidel method](https://github.com/bleachman2/Small_notebooks/blob/master/Gauss-Seidel.ipynb) uses the Gauss-Seidel method to find the solution to a square system of n linear equations with unknown x
